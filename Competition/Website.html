  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p> Our site is dedicated to providing travel tips and information for women traveling by themselves. By offering recommendations for the best restaurants, hostels, and sights, women can fully immerse themselves within a city without the anxiety that comes with traveling by oneself. We want to encourage women to explore and test their own abilities through travel. Our website is here to support them as they do this. </p>
