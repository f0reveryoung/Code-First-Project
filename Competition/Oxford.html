  <h1>Oxford</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    <p>Oxford is a stunning city in southern England, nicknamed "The Dreaming Spires" due to its famous skyline full of church towers and medieval builings.
      Oxford is most famous for the university, whose colleges are scattered around town. Many of these colleges are open to the public and the contained lawns make excellent picnic spots!
      Bear in mind that Oxford can be quite an expensive spot for food, drinks, and accomodation.</p>

         <li>For a quick bite to eat, Mission Burrito has fantastic fresh, spicy mexican food to go!</li>

         <li>Head to Cowley Road for some good value ethnic foods. We recommend Kasbah for a great selection of Mezze, or Happy Friday Kitchen for a great range of vegan fast food.</li>

      <h2>Nightlife</h2>
      Nightlife in Oxford is fairly student-oriented due to the great university presence. If you think you can brave the true student experience, head to the underground union club "Purple Turtle". If you're more in the mood for a classier, somewhat cleaner night out, The Varsity Club in the Covered Market offers great cocktails paired with breathtaking views.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Transport</h2>
      <p> Oxford is very well connected by bus to nearby towns including Abingdon, Didcot, and Wantage. There is also a bus service to all major London airports. Oxford has its own train station, but no airport. The easiest airports to get to Oxford from are Birmingham and London Heathrow.</p>
